Project Name: Odin Landing Page
Project Description: This is a landing page project for The Odin Project.
I was given the option to use images that are free to use or create my own. I was also told to have fun with the font.

Images and buttons were created using figma.

Font used: 

About the process of creation: 

July 4th: First Portion Nav and Hero.

Situation: 

Initially I could not get this code to work properly. It was extremely bloated. Flexboxes were showing up as columns instead of rows. I need to build this landing page from scratch and make it nice uniform polished presentation ready.

Task: 
Create the graphics (SVGs), Use the wireframes provided, use a color scheme, find the fonts I would like to use and link them. Also I want to use a favicon in the browser window.


Action: Changed the hero-section to row instead of column to get them horizontally aligned properly, and took the align-items off the parent div (hero-section)


Result: 

Everything is aligned and in flexboxes in the header and the hero section.
The image is the perfect size. Changed it from a small screen to a larger screen and grows perfectly. The image quality is stable because I used SVGs instead of JPEGs or PNGs. So I am going to add this to git first before continuing.
